# Integration Documentation

This section documents how different components in the application integrate with each other and with external systems.

## Contents

- [Component Integration](./COMPONENT_INTEGRATION.md) - How components work together
- [Store Integration](./STORE_INTEGRATION.md) - How components interact with stores
- [Event System](./EVENT_SYSTEM.md) - The application's event handling system
- [External Services](./EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md) - Integration with external APIs and services

## Architecture Overview

The application uses a component-based architecture with stores for state management and services for external interactions. Components communicate through a combination of:

1. **Props** - For parent-child component communication
2. **Context** - For sharing state across component trees
3. **Stores** - For global state management
4. **Events** - For cross-component communication

## Integration Principles

When integrating components and services:

1. **Loose Coupling** - Components should not depend heavily on each other
2. **Clear Interfaces** - APIs between components should be well-defined
3. **Unidirectional Data Flow** - State changes follow a predictable pattern
4. **Role-Based Integration** - Components adapt based on user roles
