# Documentation Standards

**Last Updated:** 2023-11-15

## Overview

This guide outlines the standards and practices for maintaining documentation in this project. Following these standards ensures consistency and clarity across all documentation files.

## File Organization

- Documentation is stored in the `src/docs` directory
- Each major section has its own subdirectory
- Use meaningful file names that reflect the content
- Group related documentation in the same directory
- Ensure file names use UPPERCASE for acronyms (e.g., `API_REFERENCE.md`)

## Markdown Formatting

- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Follow the heading hierarchy: # for title, ## for major sections, ### for subsections
- Use **bold** for emphasis on important concepts
- Use *italics* for terminology or slight emphasis
- Use `code formatting` for code snippets, file names, and component names
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items
- Use tables for structured data and comparisons
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections

## Code Examples

- Always include syntax highlighting in code blocks:
  ```tsx
  // TypeScript React example
  const MyComponent = () => {
    return <div>Example</div>;
  };
  ```
- Keep code examples concise and focused
- Ensure code examples are functional and accurate
- Provide comments in code examples to explain non-obvious parts
- Include both basic and advanced examples when appropriate

## Component Documentation

Each component documentation should include:

1. **Purpose** - What problem does this component solve?
2. **Usage** - How to use this component (with code examples)
3. **Props/API** - Detailed description of the component's API
4. **Dependencies** - Other components or services this component depends on
5. **Behavior** - Expected behavior and edge cases
6. **Examples** - Real examples of the component in use

## Hook Documentation

Each hook documentation should include:

1. **Purpose** - What the hook does and why it exists
2. **Parameters** - Description of all input parameters
3. **Return Value** - Description of what the hook returns
4. **Usage** - Example code showing how to use the hook
5. **Dependencies** - Any dependencies or context providers needed
6. **Side Effects** - Description of any side effects
7. **Edge Cases** - Common edge cases and how they're handled

## Integration Documentation

When documenting how components work together:

1. **Flow diagrams** - Visual representation of data and control flow
2. **Sequence diagrams** - For complex interactions
3. **Component relationship descriptions** - How components relate to each other
4. **State management** - How state is shared or isolated
5. **Event handling** - How events propagate between components

## API Documentation

For API endpoints and services:

1. **Endpoint** - The URL and HTTP method
2. **Request parameters** - All parameters and their types
3. **Request body** - Format and schema for the request body
4. **Response format** - Format and schema for the response
5. **Error responses** - Possible error states and codes
6. **Authentication** - Authentication requirements
7. **Examples** - Request and response examples

## Documentation Maintenance

- Documentation should be updated when related code changes
- Add TODOs in documentation for planned future updates
- Include the last updated date at the top of documentation files
- Review documentation regularly for accuracy
- Archive outdated documentation instead of deleting it
- Move documentation to the appropriate section if its purpose changes

## Accessibility Considerations

- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy for screen readers
- Provide alt text for images and diagrams
- Describe visual elements and diagrams in text
- Use sufficient color contrast for readability

## Documentation Review Process

Before merging new documentation:

1. Check for technical accuracy
2. Verify example code is functional
3. Proofread for grammar and clarity
4. Ensure compliance with documentation standards
5. Validate links and references
