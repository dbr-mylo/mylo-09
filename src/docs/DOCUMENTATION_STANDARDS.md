# Documentation Standards

This guide outlines the standards and practices for maintaining documentation in this project.

## File Organization

- Documentation is stored in the `src/docs` directory
- Each major section has its own subdirectory
- Use meaningful file names that reflect the content
- Group related documentation in the same directory

## Markdown Formatting

- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Follow the heading hierarchy: # for title, ## for major sections, ### for subsections
- Use **bold** for emphasis on important concepts
- Use *italics* for terminology or slight emphasis
- Use `code formatting` for code snippets, file names, and component names
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items

## Component Documentation

Each component documentation should include:

1. **Purpose** - What problem does this component solve?
2. **Usage** - How to use this component (with code examples)
3. **Props/API** - Detailed description of the component's API
4. **Dependencies** - Other components or services this component depends on
5. **Behavior** - Expected behavior and edge cases
6. **Examples** - Real examples of the component in use

## Integration Documentation

When documenting how components work together:

1. **Flow diagrams** - Visual representation of data and control flow
2. **Sequence diagrams** - For complex interactions
3. **Component relationship descriptions** - How components relate to each other
4. **State management** - How state is shared or isolated

## Keeping Documentation Updated

- Documentation should be updated when related code changes
- Add TODOs in documentation for planned future updates
- Include the last updated date at the top of documentation files
- Review documentation regularly for accuracy
