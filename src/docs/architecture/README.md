This section provides an overview of the system architecture, key patterns, and design decisions.

## Contents

- [System Overview](./SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) - High-level description of the system
- [State Management](./STATE_MANAGEMENT.md) - How state is managed throughout the application
- [Role-Based Architecture](./ROLE_BASED_ARCHITECTURE.md) - How the system handles different user roles
- [Data Flow](./DATA_FLOW.md) - How data flows through the application
- [Key Design Patterns](./DESIGN_PATTERNS.md) - Common patterns used in the application

## Architecture Principles

Our application is built on these key architectural principles:

1. **Component-based architecture** - Building UI from composable components
2. **Separation of concerns** - Keeping business logic separate from UI
3. **Role-based rendering** - Adapting the UI based on user roles
4. **State isolation** - Keeping state as local as possible
5. **Unidirectional data flow** - Predictable state changes
