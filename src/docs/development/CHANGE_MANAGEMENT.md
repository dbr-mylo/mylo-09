# Change Management Guidelines

**Last Updated:** 2023-11-20

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for making changes to the application codebase, with a focus on maintaining stability and testability throughout the development process.

## Change Management Principles

1. **Small, Focused Changes** - Make small, isolated changes to one component at a time
2. **Test-Driven Approach** - Test each change individually before integration
3. **Preserve Working Code** - Keep working implementations until replacements are proven
4. **Documentation First** - Document current behavior before making changes

## Safe Component Modification Process

### Pre-Change Assessment

Before modifying any component:

1. **Document Current Behavior**
   - Capture screenshots of current UI and interactions
   - List all expected functionality
   - Note any known limitations or bugs

2. **Identify Dependencies**
   - List all components that interact with the target component
   - Document all props and state shared with other components
   - Identify any stores or services the component depends on

3. **Create a Test Plan**
   - Identify test cases that cover all component functionality
   - Define acceptance criteria for the modified component
   - Plan for both success and error cases

### Implementation Strategy

When implementing changes:

1. **Duplicate First Approach**
   - Create a temporary copy of the component to modify
   - Make changes to the copy rather than the original
   - Keep the original component fully functional

2. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Add one feature or change at a time
   - Test each addition thoroughly before proceeding
   - Document any unexpected behavior

3. **Integration**
   - Only replace the original component after all tests pass
   - Perform integration testing with dependent components
   - Validate against the original acceptance criteria

### Example: Modifying the StyleEditorModal

```tsx
// 1. Create a temporary component
const TestStyleEditorModal = ({ style, isOpen, onClose, onStyleSaved }) => {
  // Implement basic functionality first
  // Test and confirm it works
  
  // Add form fields one by one
  // Test each field's functionality
  
  // Add style inheritance
  // Test inheritance selection and preview
  
  // Once fully tested, replace the original component
};
```

## Testing Requirements

Each change must pass:

1. **Unit Tests** - Verify individual functions and components work correctly
2. **Integration Tests** - Verify components work together as expected
3. **Visual Tests** - Verify UI appearance matches design specifications
4. **User Flow Tests** - Verify end-to-end user workflows function correctly

## Rollback Strategy

If issues are discovered after a change:

1. **Immediate Rollback** - Revert to the known-good implementation
2. **Issue Documentation** - Document the specific issues encountered
3. **Incremental Re-implementation** - Re-implement with smaller steps and additional testing

## Documentation Updates

After each change:

1. Update component documentation with new props, state, or behavior
2. Update any affected workflow documentation
3. Add or update examples showing the new functionality

## Change Review Checklist

Before submitting changes for review:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Component documentation is updated
- [ ] No regressions in dependent components
- [ ] UI matches design specifications
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
