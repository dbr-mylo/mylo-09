# Role Persistence Enhancement - Change Management Document

**Date:** 2023-11-26

## Current Behavior Documentation

### Component/Feature: useGuestRole

**Current Functionality:**
- Provides guest role management functionality
- Allows setting and clearing guest roles
- Persists roles in localStorage
- Logs role changes
- Does not implement role expiration

**Known Limitations:**
- No session expiration handling
- No user-facing indication of role duration
- No periodic updates of expiration information

**User Flows:**
- User selects guest role
- Role is persisted in localStorage
- Role is loaded on page refresh
- User can clear role

## Dependencies

### Direct Dependencies:
- Components: AuthContext, GuestRoleButtons
- Hooks: useAuth, useAuthState
- Services: None
- Utilities: roles/persistence.ts, roles/auditLogger.ts

### Shared State:
- Guest role state stored in localStorage
- Role information exposed through hook return values

### API Contracts:
- Hook returns methods for managing guest roles
- clearGuestRole must return boolean

## Test Plan

### Success Criteria:
- All existing functionality continues to work 
- Roles persist with expiration time
- Users are informed about remaining time
- Expired roles are automatically cleared
- Role changes are properly logged with additional metadata

### Test Cases:
1. Setting a guest role
   - Expected: Role is set with expiration info
   - Test: Click guest role button, verify toast with expiration time

2. Role persistence
   - Expected: Role persists with expiration time after page refresh
   - Test: Set role, refresh page, verify role is still active

3. Role expiration
   - Expected: Expired roles are automatically cleared
   - Test: Set role with short expiration, wait for expiration, verify role is cleared

4. Role clearing
   - Expected: Role is cleared from storage and state
   - Test: Click clear role button, verify role is removed

### Edge Cases:
- Invalid role assignment
- Storage errors
- Race conditions during role changes

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Component Approach

1. [x] Create test hook (useTestGuestRole)
2. [x] Create test implementation (useTestGuestRoleImplementation)
3. [x] Create test component (TestGuestRoleComponent)
4. [ ] Verify all functionality works as expected
5. [ ] Replace original implementation

### Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:
1. Continue using original useGuestRole implementation
2. Document specific issues encountered
3. Fix issues in test implementation before attempting again

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Component documentation updated
- [ ] No regressions in dependent components
- [ ] UI matches design specifications
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
