# Component Development Guidelines

This document outlines the best practices for developing components in our application.

## Component Structure

1. **Small, Focused Components**
   - Each component should do one thing well
   - Break large components into smaller, more manageable pieces
   - Aim for components under 200 lines of code

2. **Consistent File Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Name files after the component they contain
   - Group related components in folders

3. **Component Composition**
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Build complex components from simpler ones
   - Use children props to create flexible components

## State Management

1. **Local vs. Global State**
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Only elevate state when necessary
   - Use context or stores for shared state

2. **State Updates**
   - Use immutable state updates
   - Avoid direct state mutation
   - Use functional updates for state that depends on previous state

## Props

1. **Prop Design**
   - Keep required props to a minimum
   - Provide sensible defaults for optional props
   - Use TypeScript to define prop types

2. **Prop Drilling**
   - Avoid excessive prop drilling (passing props through many levels)
   - Use context for deeply nested components that need shared data
   - Consider component composition to avoid passing props through intermediary components

## Performance

1. **Memoization**
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Use useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components

2. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Keep render methods pure and simple
   - Use React DevTools to identify performance issues

## Testing

1. **Component Testing**
   - Test component rendering
   - Test user interactions
   - Test edge cases

2. **Test Organization**
   - Group tests logically
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Documentation

1. **Component Documentation**
   - Document component purpose
   - Document props and their types
   - Include usage examples

2. **Code Comments**
   - Comment complex logic
   - Explain non-obvious decisions
   - Use JSDoc for public APIs
